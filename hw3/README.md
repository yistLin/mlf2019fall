# Implementations of Logistic Regression

I implemented the algorithms in *C++17* and plotted the histograms with the help of *PGFPlots*.

## Usage

This program is tested (compilable and executable) in the environment:
- **Kernel**: Archlinux 5.4.2
- **g++ (GCC)**: 9.2.0
- **CPU**: Intel i7-9700K

To compile the program, simply

~~~bash
cmake . && cmake --build .
~~~
