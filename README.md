# ML Foundations 2019 Fall

This course is held by Hsuan-Tien Lin in NTU CSIE. ([Course Website](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/mlfound19fall/))

In this course, students have to implement 3 machine learning algorithms:
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Decision Stump
- Logistic Regression
And I implemented all of them in C++17.
